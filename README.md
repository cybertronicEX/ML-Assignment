Malignant-Benign Classification of breast cancer masses

Problem Description:

Features computed from digital pictures of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses are included in the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. Using these characteristics, the goal is to create a classification model that can differentiate between benign (non-cancerous) and malignant (cancerous) breast tumours. Comparing how well four algorithms perform in correctly identifying breast tumours as benign or cancerous is the goal. The usefulness of various supervised learning strategies for making decisions about medical diagnosis and therapy will be clarified by this analysis.
